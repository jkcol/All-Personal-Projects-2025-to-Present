# Run
stock_ai_simulator.exe
```

## Usage

### Running the Simulation
1. **Start the program**:
   ```bash
   ./stock_ai_simulator
   ```

2. **Configure parameters** when prompted:
   - **Simulation period**: Number of days to simulate (e.g., 365 for 1 year)
   - **Model accuracy**: Prediction accuracy from 0.0 to 1.0 (default: 0.68)
   - **Number of stocks**: Portfolio diversification, 1-20 stocks (recommended: 5-10)

- **Optimistic**: 0.70+ (best-case scenarios)

### Portfolio Size
- **Focused**: 1-3 stocks (concentrated strategy)
- **Balanced**: 5-10 stocks (recommended)
- **Diversified**: 15-20 stocks (maximum diversification)

## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Metrics (Based on Research)
- **Directional Accuracy**: 68%+
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 1.9+ (annualized)
- **Processing Speed**: Sub-50ms per data point

- **Execution Time**: Typically 50-500ms depending on parameters

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Compilation Errors**:
```bash
# If you get C++17 errors, try:
g++ -std=c++14 -O3 -o stock_ai_simulator stock_ai_simulator.cpp

# For older compilers:
g++ -std=c++11 -O2 -o stock_ai_simulator stock_ai_simulator.cpp
```

**Runtime Issues**:
- Ensure sufficient RAM for large simulations
- Check that input parameters are within valid ranges
- Verify write permissions for HTML output file

**Chart Display Issues**:
- Ensure internet connection for Plotly CDN
- Try different web browsers if chart doesn't load
- Check that HTML file was created successfully

### Performance Optimization

For large-scale simulations:
```bash
# Use maximum optimizations
g++ -std=c++17 -O3 -march=native -DNDEBUG -o stock_ai_simulator stock_ai_simulator.cpp

# Enable parallel processing (if available)
g++ -std=c++17 -O3 -fopenmp -o stock_ai_simulator stock_ai_simulator.cpp
```

## Understanding the Results

### Key Metrics Explained

- **Total Return**: Overall portfolio performance percentage
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return measure (higher is better)
- **Max Drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline (lower is better)
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable trades
- **Processing Time**: Computational efficiency measure

### Interpreting Performance
- **Excellent**: Sharpe > 2.0, Drawdown < 10%
- **Good**: Sharpe > 1.5, Drawdown < 15%
- **Acceptable**: Sharpe > 1.0, Drawdown < 20%
- **Needs Improvement**: Sharpe < 1.0 or Drawdown > 25%

## Limitations & Disclaimers

### Simulation Limitations
- Uses synthetic market data (not real historical prices)
- Simplified execution model (no slippage, market impact)
- Perfect information assumption (no data delays)
- No transaction costs or regulatory constraints

### Important Notes
- **This is a simulation for educational/research purposes only**
- **Not suitable for live trading without significant modifications**
- **Past performance does not guarantee future results**
- **Real trading involves substantial risk of loss**

### For Production Use
To adapt for live trading, you would need:
- Real market data feeds (Bloomberg, Reuters, etc.)
- Broker API integration (Interactive Brokers, TD Ameritrade, etc.)
- Risk management systems
- Regulatory compliance (SEC, FINRA, etc.)
- Production infrastructure with failover systems
